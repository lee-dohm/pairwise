The Test::Pairwise module is a collection of tools and utilities for generating 
sets of test cases by using the "all pairs" approach to find a smaller set of 
test cases (rather than an exhaustive set of test cases) from a set of
independent equivalence classes.

See http://www.pairwise.org for more details.

My current approach is to:

# Read the table of dimensions and the associated values.
# Repeat until all required combinations are covered:
## Randomly pick values from the dimensions to create a test case.
## If the test case has covered at least one uncovered combination, store it.

This implementation is expected to be slow and will need to be refined over
time.
